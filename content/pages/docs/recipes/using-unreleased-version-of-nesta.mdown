Summary: You might want to use features that are in the development branch of Nesta but were not yet released as a gem, or you might want to use your own version of Nesta. This recipe will explain how.

# Using an unreleased version of Nesta

Let's say that there's a cool new feature of Nesta you want to try, but has not yet been packaged as a gem. With Bundler there's an easy way to use the bleeding edge version of Nesta for your projects.

You'll need to replace the line in your Gemfile about Nesta with the following:

    gem "nesta", :git => "git://github.com/gma/nesta.git"
    
And then run: 

    bundle install
    
VoilÃ , you are now running the latest development version of Nesta. 
    
Maybe that particular feature you want is in a specific branch other than master. You can specify which branch you want, for example:

    gem "nesta", :git    => "git://github.com/gma/nesta.git", 
                 :branch => "gem-plugins"

In fact, when we pass the :git option only, the master branch is assumed.

Note also that this can be used to specify **your own** branch or repository, so that Nesta can have all the features you built. For example:

    gem "nesta", :git => "git://github.com/your-name/nesta.git"
    
Be warned that this requires a *.gemspec* file in your project folder. If you don't have one you should pass a version number to Bundler so that it can resolve dependencies, as in:

    gem "nesta", "0.9.11", 
                 :git => "git://github.com/your-name/nesta.git"
