# Recipes

Each Nesta Recipe shows how to approach a common task, such as adding
author biographies or setting up syntax highlighting. They include
example code that you can use in your own site, or as inspiration for
how to get the most out of Nesta.

If you've got an idea for a new recipe, we'd love to hear about it (you
can email your idea to the mailing list at <nesta@librelist.com>, or
contact [@nestacms][] on Twitter).

Credit for the idea of publishing a list of recipes goes to Adam
Stakoviac of [The Changelog][] fame.
