# Using Google Analytics

Google's free [analytics software][analytics] is a great way to keep
track of how many people are using your web site, and it's very easy to
configure. You just add the "web property ID" that Google give you when
you sign up to the config file.

## Configuring config.yml

Open the `config/config.yml` file in a text editor and search for
`google_analytics_code`. Uncomment it, and set it to your site's web
property ID. The web property ID usually starts with "UA", and will look
something like this:

    google_analytics_code: UA-1234567-8

## Adding Google's JavaScript to the page

Whether or not Google Analyics is enabled for your site is controlled by
the Haml template that is responsible for rendering the page. Nesta
comes with a theme that adds Google's HTML and JavaScript, and many
other themes also call it by default.

If the theme or templates that you're using don't include the JavaScript
you can insert the relevant code by adding a line like this in your
layout template:

    = haml :analytics, :layout => false

[analytics]: https://www.google.com/analytics
