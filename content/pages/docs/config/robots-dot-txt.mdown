Summary: How to create a robots.txt file.

# Editing robots.txt

Web crawler software (often known as "robots") are continually
traversing the web and downloading the pages they find. If you'd like to
keep them out of a part of your site, you can tell them what to avoid by
setting up a `robots.txt` file.

By default, Nesta will respond with a blank `robots.txt`. If you want
to add your own `robots.txt` instructions create a new `robots.txt` file
and place it in the `public` directory.

See <https://robotstxt.org> for details of how to write the file.
