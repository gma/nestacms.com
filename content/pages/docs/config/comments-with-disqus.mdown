Summary: Comments are easily added to a Nesta site through a third party site like Disqus.

# Comments with Disqus

Comments are easily added to a Nesta site through [Disqus][disqus], a
third party "comments platform". Comments are added to your web pages
with a small snippet of JavaScript code. You moderate the comments by
logging into your Disqus account.

While Disqus isn't the only service that you can use to serve comments
on your site (see [Intense Debate][intdeb] and [CoComment][coco]),
Disqus is currently the only one that is supported out of the box. Once
you've created a Disqus account and added your web site to it, all you
need to do is to tell Nesta what your site's Disqus key is (which Disqus
refer to as your "short name").

[coco]: http://www.cocomment.com/

## Configuring config.yml

Open the `config/config.yml` file in a text editor and search for
`disqus_short_name`. Uncomment it, and set your site's short name. It
will look something like this:

    disqus_short_name: mysite

## Showing comments on a page

Whether or not comments are shown on a page is controlled by the Haml
template that is responsible for rendering the page. Nesta comes with a
template that will add the Disqus HTML and JavaScript, and some themes
call it by default.

If the theme or templates that you're using don't include comments you
can insert the relevant code by adding a line like this in your
template:

    = haml :comments, :layout => false
