# Sluggable plugin

Allows you to use numeric (or timestamped) filenames while
serving your pages with an optional slug for SEO purposes. This has a
few benefits:

* You can change the slug if your headline changes and Nesta will
  automatically find the new article.
* You don't have to know your headline and slug when you create your
  file.
* Mangled, truncated URLs can still find the way to the latest version
  of your page.


The plugin adds a a new metadata key ('slug') that you can set on each
page in order to specify the slug to be used in the URL for that page.
If you do not specify the slug in the metadata, Sluggable will dasherize
your page heading.

## Installation

    $ cd path/to/site
    $ echo 'gem "nesta-plugin-sluggable" >> Gemfile'
    $ bundle
