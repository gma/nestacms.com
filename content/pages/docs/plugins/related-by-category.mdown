# Related-by-category plugin

This plugin examines the category metadata that you have assigned to
your site's pages and uses it to find the pages/articles that relate
most closely to the page that is currently being served.

You can use it to create links to other pages that your visitors might
be interested in reading.

By default, up to three related articles will be shown but you can
specify any number you like.

## Installation

    $ cd path/to/site
    $ echo 'gem "nesta-plugin-related-by-category" >> Gemfile'
    $ bundle

The plugin defines a couple of useful helper methods for use in your
page template. Here's an example (modify as you see fit, and use it in
your site's template):

    - if has_related_articles?(@page)
      %section.related-articles
        %h2 Related articles
        %ul
          - related_by_category(@page).each do |article|
            %li
              %a{ href: article.abspath }= article.heading
