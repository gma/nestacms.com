# Linkable plugin


Allows you to easily create posts that link to remote URLs, [Daring
Fireball][] style.

The plugin adds a a new metadata key ('url') that you can set on each
page in order to specify the URL for the remote article. Nesta's
`url_for` helper will resolve to the remote URL for easy linking in link
posts and in your Atom feed.
