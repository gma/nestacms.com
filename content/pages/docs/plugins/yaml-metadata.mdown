# YAML metadata plugin

Nesta's metadata is stored in simple key/value pairs. The values always
have to be strings, but if you need something a bit more structured
install this plugin and you can use [YAML][] instead.

For example, if you wanted to put an array in your document, you could
do this:

    Meaning of:
      - life
      - 42

    # Title of page...

    Body copy...

And then in your template, you'd find that this:

    @page.metadata('meaning of')

would return:

    ['life', 42]
